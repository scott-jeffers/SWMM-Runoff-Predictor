# Lightweight SWMM Runoff Predictor
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Author:** Marcus Quigley

A single-file Python script that predicts real-time stormwater runoff from a single catchment area using the core hydrology calculations from the official EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5).

This script connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live precipitation data and applies scientifically validated methods to provide a continuous, real-time estimate of runoff in cubic feet per second (cfs).

## Core Concepts

This tool is a Python translation and simplification of the powerful and complex EPA SWMM 5 C-language engine. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to run for quick, real-time predictions without needing a full SWMM input file or installation.

The script faithfully implements three key SWMM 5 methods:

1.  **Nonlinear Reservoir Model:** Surface runoff is calculated by treating the catchment surface as a nonlinear reservoir where the outflow is governed by the Manning equation.
2.  **Horton Infiltration:** Infiltration into pervious land surfaces is modeled using the widely-accepted Horton method, which simulates the decay of infiltration rate as the soil becomes saturated.
3.  **Adaptive ODE Solver:** To ensure numerical accuracy, the change in surface water depth over time is solved using an adaptive 5th-order Runge-Kutta method, just as in the original SWMM engine.

## Features

* **Real-Time Data:** Fetches live, hourly precipitation data from the OpenWeatherMap "Current Weather Data" API.
* **SWMM 5 Calculations:** Utilizes the core hydrology algorithms from the EPA SWMM 5 engine.
* **Configurable Catchment:** Easily configure the physical characteristics of your watershed (area, slope, imperviousness, etc.) within the script.
* **Self-Contained:** All logic is contained in a single Python file with a minimal dependency (`requests`).
* **Educational:** Provides a clear, object-oriented Python implementation of complex hydrological processes, making it a great learning tool.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to get the script running.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* The `requests` library. If you don't have it, install it via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

### 2. Get an API Key

* Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
* Navigate to your user dashboard and find the **"API keys"** tab.
* Copy your default API key.

### 3. Configure the Script

* Open this script in a text editor.
* **Set your API Key:** In the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with the key you copied from OpenWeatherMap.
* **Set Your Location:** Change the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` to your area of interest.
* **(Optional) Configure the Watershed:** Adjust the `watershed_params` dictionary to match the characteristics of your catchment.

### 4. Run the Script

* Save your changes.
* Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
